# data-analysis-for-world-university-ranking-
Overview:
This project is about analyzing and visualizing Times World University Ranking 2011 â€“ 2016
dataset. I have collected this dataset from Kaggle.com. This dataset is about the ranking of
world-leading universities from the year 2011 to 2016. It has a total of 14 variables including
World_Rank, University_Name, Country, Teaching_Rating, Inter_Outlook_Rating,
Research_Rating, Citations_Rating, Industry_Income_Rating, Total_Score, Num_Students,
Student_to_Staff_Ratio, percent_Inter_Students, percent_Female_Students, and Year. I have
selected this dataset because it will be crucial and helpful to know what are the important criteria
influencing universities to do well in the world ranking. Besides, it will be helpful to know the
demographic performance of universities across the world. In addition, I am very interested in
the higher education sector, and being an international student myself, I have selected this dataset
to understand the descriptive statistics about the universities and the criteria that influence the
ranking through the functions as well as the visual presentation. Those criteria include
Teaching_Rating, Inter_Outlook_Rating, Research_Rating, Citations_Rating,
Industry_Income_Rating. The dataset is collected from and available at
